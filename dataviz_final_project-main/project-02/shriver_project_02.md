## Mini-Project 2

For this project I chose to work with the "All Billboard Summer Hits" dataset, which includes Spotify data on various songs that charted on Billboard.

## Interactive plot of relationship between danceability and energy
The first plot created looks at how the measured energy of a song impacts it's danceability, with the coloration based on the time signature of the song. The results show that the two values seem to be correlated with each other. I had made the assumption that songs with a 4 time signature would be considered more danceable, and while that seems to be the case there are so few songs in 3 or 5 that it is hard to draw a conclusion.

## Modelling relationship between loudness and energy
This plot centers around seeing if loudness and energy are positively correlated with each other, which is demonstrated with the visuals. The best linear fit line is able to go straight through the middle of the data points.
